# PMy Restaurant List

This is a backend programming assignment from the Alpha Camp bootcamp: a restaurant list website built using Node.js + Express, which includes various restaurant information for users to browse, view details, and search.

## Features:

1. Users can browse all restaurants and view basic information such as name, category, image, and rating.
2. Users can click on any restaurant to view detailed information including name, category, address, phone number, description, and images.
3. Users can search for restaurants by Chinese name, English name, or category, with case-insensitive and space-insensitive matching.

### Prerequisites
```
Node.js v20.11.1
```

### Installing

Open your terminal and clone the project to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/donaldwongsuisang/restaurant-list
```

Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd path/restaurant-list
```

Install npm packages:
```
npm install
```

Install Express:

```

Install nodemon:

Start the server by running the app.js file:

When you see the following message in the terminal, it indicates that the server and database have started successfully:
